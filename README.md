# Itheum Data Coalition

The Itheum Data Coalition smart contract facilitates the business-relevant processes of Data Coalition DAOs on the [Itheum](https://itheum.io) protocol, ensuring compatibility with the [PeerMe](https://peerme.io) DAO platform. This contract enables internet-native entities (Cryptocompanies, communities, DAOs, etc.) to manage, delegate, and govern data efficiently and securely within the Itheum ecosystem.

## Data Providers

Data is the core asset of a Data Coalition, contributed by various data providers. Through the smart contract, data providers can delegate their data NFTs to the Data Coalition, enabling the organization to manage and utilize the data according to the governance policies and agreements.

## Governance

Governance within the Data Coalition is conducted by a board, consisting of members with significant stakes locked in the contract. Decisions are made based on a simple majority, with the possibility of specifying alternative governance models on the connected DAO platform. The governance framework is designed to ensure that all decisions reflect the collective will of the coalition's members, promoting transparency and fairness.
